# CMake Journey

## CMake
Here is a safe space repository where I learn CMake, CTest & CPack and the likes.
It's not all about just CMake, this repository also includes (but not limited) the following:
* Semantic Versioning
* Git & Github skills
* Code documentation
* Package releases
and various other aspects that will be added as time proceeds. In essence, this is a programming playground.

## Other

### Git & Github
This repository is also for learning, experimenting and/or testing of git commands i.e tag, rebasing, manipulating history etc...

### Semantic Versioning
This repository is also for learning, improving, experimenting and testing out semantic versioning 2.0.0
[https://semver.org/]

## Rules
### Changes
All experiments, changes & commits shall and must be done of their own branch, irrespective of how minor or major the changes are.
