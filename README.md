# CMake Journey

## CMake
Here is a safe space repository where I learn CMake, CTest & CPack and the likes.
It's not all about just CMake, this repository also includes (but not limited) the following:
* Semantic Versioning
* Git & Github skills
* Code documentation
* Package releases
and various other aspects that will be added as time proceeds. In essence, this is a programming playground.

## Other

### Git & Github
This repository is also for learning, experimenting and/or testing of git commands i.e tag, rebasing, manipulating history etc...

### Semantic Versioning
This repository is also for learning, improving, experimenting and testing out semantic versioning 2.0.0
[https://semver.org/]

## Rules
### Changes
All experiments, changes & commits shall and must be done of their own branch, irrespective of how minor or major the changes are.

### Lessons
The purpose of this repository is to learn CMake and to grow the skill. Therefore, for the sake of structure, all new elements learned 
must be done so in the Lessons/ directory by creating a new folder named by the next increment integer of folder names followed by the 
name of what is being learn. 
For instance if the folder is for learning VCPKG & will be the 1st folder, then the folder should be named 
as follows:
1-vcpkg
